BEFORE GETTING STARTED
1.Make sure your screen resolution is set to 1920x1080 and scaled text is text to 100% (image provided in discord server)

- Inside of Roblox
2.Go to settings
3.Set Camera Sensitivty --> 1
4.Shift Lock Switch --> Off
5.Camera Mode --> Default (classic)
6.Movement Mode --> Click to Move
7.Camera Inverted --> Off
That will be all, AFTER you have done this, you can continue with the actual guide!

- Script
1. Extract the file to your desktop or a place of your liking, then open the file, head to v1 and run FixedFarmX.exe

2. Go inside Anime Adventures, make sure Roblox IS NOT FULL SCREEN and FixedFarm does not align with Roblox itself. Do not change the camera.

3. Inside the script menu, head to settings, and select the units you want to use in game
⚠WARNING! ⚠ Make sure the units are equipped from LEFT to RIGHT. This means fill the units from left to right, leave no gabs or the script will MALFUNCTION (see image as example). You can leave them empty or as unit, but again as long as it is from left to right aligned with the units menu. Also, favor using minimal units, for example: hybrid + ground or hill + ground, or just hybrid. But this is your own choice

4. Press F1, sit back and relax.
